> Open links without leaving the keyboard!

Are you a fan of keyboard shortcuts? Do you ever find yourself annoyed that you have to move your hands to the mouse to click a link? Then this extension might be for you.

Press `s` to start listening. Type two characters matching the start of the link or button text. Youâ€™ll immediately focus on the first instance, if there is one. Follow up with `;` and `,` to jump around other instances; hit `Escape` to cancel and try a different search.

Once you have the link you want, you can use normal keyboard shortcuts - `Enter` to open in the current tab, `Command-Enter` to open in a new tab, `Tab` to move forward to nearby links, and `Shift-Tab` to move backward to nearby links.
