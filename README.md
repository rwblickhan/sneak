> Open links without leaving the keyboard!

Are you a fan of keyboard shortcuts? Do you ever find yourself annoyed that you have to move your hands to the mouse to click a link? Then this extension might be for you.

Press `s` to start listening. Type two characters matching the link text. If thereâ€™s a unique match, the link opens immediately! If not, keep typing or select a numbered option while holding Control or âŒ˜ (Command). If you want to open links in a new tab, start with `S` (`Shift-s`) instead.
